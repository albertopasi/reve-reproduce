# HPC Data & Model Layout

This document describes which large files live outside the git repo and where
they are/to place them on the HPC machine, so that all code paths resolve correctly
without any changes to source files.

---

## HPC directory layout

The HPC has two mount points:

```
/scratch/apasinato/    ← large files (SSD, fast I/O): data/ and models/
/home/apasinato/       ← rest of the repo (code, configs, outputs, etc.)
```

The git repository root (`reve-reproduce/`) lives under `/home/apasinato/`.
The `data/` and `models/` directories are NOT committed to git and are placed separately on the scratch disk. The code references them via paths in
`configs/thu_ep.yml` and inline constants — see the "path mapping" section
below (need to check/update the paths)

---

## What is in `/scratch/apasinato/`

### 1. THU-EP raw data — `data/thu ep/EEG data/`

- **Size**: ~24 GB
- **Contents**: 80 MATLAB v7.3 (HDF5) files, named `sub_1.mat` … `sub_80.mat`
  (1-indexed, no leading zero).
- **Format**: Each file contains a single variable `data` of shape
  `(7500, 32, 28, 6)` = (timepoints at 250 Hz, channels, stimuli, frequency
  bands). dtype float64. Units: **microvolts (µV)**.
- **Why needed**: The preprocessing pipeline reads these to produce
  `preprocessed_v2/`. Once preprocessing is done on the HPC you do NOT need
  to keep them on the fast disk, but they are required for the first run.

### 2. THU-EP auxiliary files — `data/thu ep/Others/` and `data/thu ep/Ratings/`

- **Size**: negligible (two small .mat files)
- `Others/label.mat` — stimulus-to-label mapping (used historically; labels
  are now hard-coded in `src/thu_ep/dataset.py`)
- `Ratings/ratings.mat` — subjective emotion ratings per subject/stimulus

### 3. THU-EP readme — `data/thu ep/Readme.pdf`

- One PDF, included with the dataset.

### 4. FACED preprocessed data — `data/FACED/Processed_data/`

- **Size**: ~6.2 GB
- **Contents**: 123 pickle files named `sub000.pkl` … `sub122.pkl`
  (0-indexed, three-digit zero-padded).
- **Format**: Each file deserialises to a `numpy.ndarray` of shape
  `(28, 32, 7500)` = (stimuli, channels, timepoints at 250 Hz). dtype float64.
  Units: **microvolts (µV)**. Mean ≈ 0 (already re-referenced & bandpass
  filtered by FACED authors).
- **Why needed**: Used by the REVE official reproduction pipeline
  (`reve_eeg-main/`). The preprocessing script reads these and converts them
  to an LMDB database (`data/FACED/processed/`) before training.

### 5. FACED metadata — `data/FACED/` (root-level files)

- **Size**: negligible
- `Dataset_description.md`, `Readme.md`, `manifest.csv`,
  `Recording_info.csv`, `Electrode_Location.xlsx`, `DataStructureOfBehaviouralData.xlsx`,
  `Stimuli_info.xlsx`, `Task_event.xlsx`
- useful for reference.

### 6. REVE pretrained models — `models/reve_pretrained_original/`

- **Size**: ~1.8 GB total
- These are **local HuggingFace model snapshots** downloaded from
  `brain-bzh/reve-base`, `brain-bzh/reve-large`, and `brain-bzh/reve-positions`.
  They are loaded via `AutoModel.from_pretrained(local_path, trust_remote_code=True)`.

```

    │   ├── configuration_reve.py
    │   ├── modeling_reve.py

        ├── position_bank.py
        ├── positions.json
        └── README.md
```

**Only `reve-base` and `reve-positions` are used** by the thesis code.
`reve-large` is present locally but not referenced anywhere in `src/`.

## Directories NOT to copy (ignorable)

- `data/thu ep/cl_cs_preprocessed/` — obsolete intermediate format from an
  abandoned experiment, can be deleted entirely
- `data/thu ep/embeddings/` — pre-computed embedding caches from old pipeline
  (z-scored data); will be regenerated after re-preprocessing
- `data/thu ep/preprocessed/` — old preprocessed .npy files with z-score
  normalization applied; **superseded by `preprocessed_v2/`** (see below)
- `outputs/` — training checkpoints and results from old runs; regenerated on HPC

---

## Directories generated on HPC (do not need to transfer)

These are produced by running the pipeline on the HPC and should be created
there from scratch:

| Directory | Created by | Contents |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| `data/thu ep/preprocessed_v2/` | `run_preprocessing.py` | 79 `.npy` files, shape (28, 30, 6000), float32, raw µV (no z-score) |
| `data/FACED/processed/` | `reve_eeg-main/preprocessing/preprocessing_faced.py` | LMDB database for REVE official training |
| `data/thu ep/embeddings/` | `train_lp.py` (first run) | Cached REVE embeddings per subject |
| `outputs/` | all training scripts | Checkpoints, results, WandB logs |

---

## Path configuration

The code resolves data paths through `configs/thu_ep.yml`. On the HPC, update
the `paths` section to point to the scratch disk:

```yaml
paths:
  raw_data_dir:           "../../scratch/apasinato/data/thu ep/EEG data"
  preprocessed_output_dir: "../../scratch/apasinato/data/thu ep/preprocessed_v2"
```

Or, more robustly, use absolute paths:

```yaml
paths:
  raw_data_dir:           "/scratch/apasinato/data/thu ep/EEG data"
  preprocessed_output_dir: "/scratch/apasinato/data/thu ep/preprocessed_v2"
```

The REVE model path is passed inline when constructing `EmbeddingExtractor`
in `src/approaches/linear_probing/model.py` — update it to:

```python
reve_model_path = Path("/scratch/apasinato/models/reve_pretrained_original/reve-base")
reve_pos_path   = Path("/scratch/apasinato/models/reve_pretrained_original/reve-positions")
```

For the REVE official reproduction (`reve_eeg-main/`), pass `data_root` as a
CLI override:

```bash
python dt.py task=faced data_root=/scratch/apasinato/data ...
```

## Summary: what to `rsync` to `/scratch/apasinato/`

```bash
rsync -av --progress \
  "data/thu ep/EEG data/"          /scratch/apasinato/data/thu\ ep/EEG\ data/
  "data/thu ep/Others/"            /scratch/apasinato/data/thu\ ep/Others/
  "data/thu ep/Ratings/"           /scratch/apasinato/data/thu\ ep/Ratings/
  "data/thu ep/Readme.pdf"         /scratch/apasinato/data/thu\ ep/
  "data/FACED/"                    /scratch/apasinato/data/FACED/
  "models/reve_pretrained_original/" /scratch/apasinato/models/reve_pretrained_original/
```

Total to transfer: ≈ **32 GB** (24 GB THU-EP raw + 6.2 GB FACED + 1.8 GB models).
